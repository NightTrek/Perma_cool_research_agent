The key details I was able to gather are:
- Trusty Manufacturing is the legal business name, with the DBA name of Lost Coast Alchemy
- The license number is CDPH-10002403 and the license is active for adult-use and medicinal cannabis
- The business owner is Daniel Mcquiston, and his email is Dmcq87@gmail.Com
- The company website is https://trustydistro.com/, but it does not provide much information about the company's products, revenue, or size.
- I was unable to find definitive information about the company's specific products, revenue size, or number of employees.
