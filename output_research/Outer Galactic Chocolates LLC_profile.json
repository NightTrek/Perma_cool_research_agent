The search results indicate that Outer Galactic Chocolates LLC is a cannabis edibles company that produces infused and edible products. The company was acquired by Halo Labs in 2020. Outer Galactic Chocolates holds a Type N license in California to produce cannabis products. 

The key executives identified are the business owners: Justin Greene, Katharyn Field, and Kiranjit Sidhu. Contact information was only found for Justin Greene, whose email is Justin.Nv@haloco.Com.

The search did not uncover any specific information about the company's product offerings, revenue size, or number of employees. The only website found was for a related brand called "Outer Space Candy" which appears to sell freeze-dried candy, but it's unclear if this is a product of Outer Galactic Chocolates.

Overall, the available information provides a high-level overview of the company and its key decision makers, but lacks specific details about their product catalog, financial performance, and company size.
